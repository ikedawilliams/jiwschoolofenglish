    <h1>Lesson Policy / レッスンポリシー</h1>

    <!-- English -->
   <div class="lang lang-en">
  <h2>Lesson Policy</h2>

  <p>This policy exists to keep lessons fair, flexible, and stress-free for both students and teacher. It protects lesson quality, scheduling stability, and mutual respect.</p>

  <h3>1. Booking System</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Lessons are booked <strong>month by month</strong>.</li>
    <li>Students choose lesson dates and times based on current availability.</li>
    <li>Lesson slots are <strong>not automatically held</strong> beyond the current booking period.</li>
    <li>If you plan to travel, take a break, or change your schedule, you are free to book fewer lessons or pause for a month.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>No long-term obligation. No pressure.</strong></p>

  <h3>2. Cancellations &amp; Rescheduling</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Lessons cancelled with <strong>at least 24 hours’ notice</strong> may be rescheduled (subject to availability).</li>
    <li>Lessons cancelled <strong>within 24 hours</strong> are counted as completed and cannot be rescheduled.</li>
    <li>This includes cancellations due to illness, work, family matters, or travel.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This policy exists because lesson time is reserved exclusively for you.</p>

  <h3>3. Missed Lessons (No-Shows)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If a student does not attend a scheduled lesson and provides no notice, the lesson is considered completed.</li>
    <li>No refunds or make-up lessons are provided for no-shows.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Holidays &amp; Teacher Absences</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Japanese national holidays may reduce the number of available lessons in a given month.</li>
    <li>If the teacher must cancel a lesson, the lesson will be rescheduled or credited.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>5. Taking Time Off</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>You are welcome to take time off at any point.</li>
    <li>If you plan to travel or reduce lessons, simply <strong>book fewer lessons</strong> or <strong>skip a month</strong>.</li>
    <li>Random or occasional bookings are possible, but lesson times cannot be held without confirmed bookings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This ensures fairness for all students and prevents unused time blocks.</p>

  <h3>6. Payments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Payments are made monthly, based on the number of lessons booked.</li>
    <li>Payment confirms your reservation of lesson slots.</li>
    <li>Lessons are not guaranteed until payment is completed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7. Lesson Style &amp; Expectations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Lessons focus on <strong>speaking, accuracy, and natural English</strong>.</li>
    <li>Immediate corrections are part of the learning process.</li>
    <li>Students are encouraged to speak actively and ask questions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Respect, effort, and communication are expected from both sides.</p>

  <h3>8. Mutual Respect</h3>
  <p>JIW School of English values long-term relationships built on trust, consistency, and clear communication.</p>
  <p>If you are ever unsure about scheduling, payments, or lesson expectations, please ask. We are flexible — but clarity keeps everything running smoothly.</p>

  <p><strong>Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.</strong></p>
